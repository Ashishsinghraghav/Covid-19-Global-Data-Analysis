## COVID-19 Global Data Analysis and Visualization

* In this project, I collected global COVID-19 data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering GitHub repository. Using Python, I performed extensive data cleaning and transformation on the raw data to create a clean and comprehensive dataset for analysis. I then imported this dataset into Power BI and designed a series of interactive dashboards to visualize key trends and insights.

* Some of the analyses and visualizations I performed in Power BI include:

 * Geospatial mapping of COVID-19 cases and deaths by country and region
 * Time series analysis of case and death counts over time
 * Comparative analysis of case and death rates across countries and regions
 * Demographic analysis of COVID-19 impact on different age groups and genders
 * Identification of key hotspots and emerging trends in COVID-19 spread 

* Through my analysis, I was able to uncover several key trends and insights related to the global impact of COVID-19, including regional variations in case and death rates, the impact of demographic factors on COVID-19 outcomes, and the emergence of new hotspots and trends over time. Overall, this project provides a comprehensive and data-driven analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the global community.
